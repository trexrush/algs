# About
I want to have a central place to share the algorithms I use for speedcolving the Rubik's Cube.

# Goals for this Project
Be able to have an algsheet with inline visualizations, have it be data driven so its easy to modify, and have it be able to be shipped as a Progressive web app so it has the offline power of a PDF.

[Link to my current algsheet which I put a lot of effort into so tbh idk why i decided to redo it as a website](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L0iR5AyRh2sTWymHSD2MiTJXzl8IoxGzyuRgqEhttSs/edit#gid=1313953242)
