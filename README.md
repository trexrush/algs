# About
I want to have a central place to share the algorithms I use for speedcolving the Rubik's Cube with inline visualizations, have it be data driven so its easy to modify, and have it be able to be shipped as a Progressive web app so it has the offline power of a PDF.

## Future 2.0 Plans

- use logo for github / gsheets link
- create gridlayout
- maintain collapsed / selected algs in localstorage/cache
- make dark mode toggleable
- add info card to navbar or page layouts
- move these to github issues :sob: :skull:
- collapse all sets
- algorithmically handle INVERSE, DOUBLE, LEFTY, BACK trigger modifiers
- expand triggers on demand / styling
- implement mirror toggle in site
- link to trainer once thats set up?
- allow algs/set to show up in a set order and mix up algs/sets? (wanted for PLL, needed to pull OLL/PLL from sheet)
- manually check all algs for correct direction of _2 / _2' moves
- add Parity OLL/PLL, OLL, H/Pi ZBLL
