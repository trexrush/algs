# About
I want to have a central place to share the algorithms I use for speedcolving the Rubik's Cube.

# Goals for this Project
Be able to have an algsheet with inline visualizations, have it be data driven so its easy to modify, and have it be able to be shipped as a Progressive web app so it has the offline power of a PDF.

[Link to my current algsheet which I put a lot of effort into so tbh idk why i decided to redo it as a website](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L0iR5AyRh2sTWymHSD2MiTJXzl8IoxGzyuRgqEhttSs/edit#gid=1313953242)

# Development

## Stack

Astro, Tailwind, Svelte

## Todo

- make some flag to bypass algvis or us a different alg than display? maybe a shorthand?
(ex. where I say fruruf [ZBLL] or the pll parity cases like [J PERM] [PARITY])
- add comments to format
- allow algs/set to show up in a set order and mix up algs/sets?
- come up with / implement a good system for local images
- option to invert an alg to show the right handed version (change name too?)
- maintain collapsed / selected algs in localstorage
- TRY to make PWA
- back button
- link to twizzle? link to trainer once thats set up?
- add OLL, EG/CLL, ZBLL, Parity OLL/PLL
