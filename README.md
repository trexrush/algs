# About
I want to have a central place to share the algorithms I use for speedcolving the Rubik's Cube.

# Goals for this Project
Be able to have an algsheet with inline visualizations, have it be data driven so its easy to modify, and have it be able to be shipped as a Progressive web app so it has the offline power of a PDF.

[Link to my current algsheet which I put a lot of effort into so tbh idk why i decided to redo it as a website](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L0iR5AyRh2sTWymHSD2MiTJXzl8IoxGzyuRgqEhttSs/edit#gid=1313953242)

# Development

## Stack

Astro, Tailwind, Svelte

## Todo (roughly in order)

Core Features:
- dark mode

Future:
- github logo
- create gridlayout
- maintain collapsed / selected algs in localstorage/cache
- move these to github issues :sob: :skull:
- collapse all
- expand triggers on demand / styling
- implement mirror toggle in frontend
- link to twizzle? link to trainer once thats set up?
- allow algs/set to show up in a set order and mix up algs/sets? (wanted for PLL, needed to pull OLL/PLL from sheet)
- add Parity OLL/PLL, PLL, OLL



## Get Started

```
pnpm i

astro run dev
```
